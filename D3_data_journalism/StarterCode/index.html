          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h2>
          <p>In Utah the median age of population is the lowest in all of The United States. It is equals to 30.5 years old. 
            Also, Utah has the lowest level of smokers - 9.7%. The highest level of smokers is in West Virginia - 26.7%. 
            Additionaly, West Virginia is the state with one of the highest median age of - 41.9 years old. The state’s high rate of 
            tobacco use attributes to the fact that it is a mostly rural area with many residents of lower socioeconomic 
            status and little education. Tobacco use is more common in rural areas than cities. And the less educated and 
            poorer people are, the more likely they are to smoke, according to West Virginia’s residents. The fact that West 
            Virginia until recently had one of the lowest cigarette taxes in the nation is also a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>New Hampshire is the state with the lowest poverty level - 9.2%. On the contrary Mississippi and New Mexico are 
            two states with the highest poverty level, 21.5% and 21.3% respectivly. Wealthy states, such as Maryland, Connecticut, 
            and New Jersey, tend to have high education level among citizens and are located in close proximity to major 
            economic hubs, such as New York City and Boston. Poorer states almost invariably have a less-educated population 
            and offer less in the way of economic opportunity. Low poverty level in New Hempshire is a result of the state’s strong 
            economy and low unemployment rate in recent years.</p>
